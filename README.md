# Reactor Deck

A full stack flashcard web app designed for studying. This project features user authentication and dynamic data thanks to Supabase.
This took me about a month to finish. This is my first React project that uses multiple routes. There are probably some bugs I am not aware of, so feedback is highly appreciated. That's about it, thank you.
